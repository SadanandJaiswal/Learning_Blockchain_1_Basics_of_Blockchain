consensus: 

Types of consensus:
1) proof of Work
2) proof of Stake

chain selection:

sybil resistance:

block confirmation: number of block added to the chain after our transaction added to the block

nakamoto consensus: combination of proof of work and longest chain selection



** minner are in proof of work network
** validator are in proof of stake network


Attack that can happen on blockchain:
1) sybil attack:
2) 51% attack: 


bigger the blockchain is more decentralized and more secure


** proof of work use lots of electricity

eth2.0 will have proof of stake


scalibility:

sharding:

layer1: base layer blocchain implementation , e.g: ethereum , bitcoin, avalanche
layer2: any application built on top of layer 1 , e.g: chainlink, optimism

rollups:

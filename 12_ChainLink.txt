// Oracle Problem / Smart contract connectivity problem
// Smart Contracts are unable to connect with external systems, data feeds, APIs, existing payment systems or any other off-chain resources on their own.

soltion to this problem:
Blockchain Oracle: Any device that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts.

Chain link:
can be completely customized to bring any data any ethernal computation

data.chain.link

http://docs.chain.link/

Features of chain link:
1) chainlink data feed:
2) chainlink VRF:
3) chainlink keepers:
4) chainlink ANY APIs: 

blockchain node can't conenct to api but chainlink do

whenever we request data from chainlink node we need to some oracle gas / link token
add test links to metamak account

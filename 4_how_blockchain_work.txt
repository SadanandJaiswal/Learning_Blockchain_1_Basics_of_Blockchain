hash: unique fixed length string to identify piece of data

mining: the process of finding the solution to the blockchain problem (hash with four starting zero)

block: list of transaction minned together

block structure:
block, nonce, data, prev (hash), hash(use all block(no), nonce, data)

nonce: number used once to find the solution to the blockchain problem

**
try brute force to nonce to get the number of starting zeros in hash 

genesis block: first block in the blockchain

blockchain: 

**
decentralized

tokens: 

account addrress: created using public key / is public key

private key: use to sing the transaction
public key : use to verify the signature

** each blockchain keeps list
